		<description><![CDATA[1. The only way is up Whether you’re stepping into&#160;[&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>1. The only way is up</h4>
<p>Whether you’re stepping into an interview, gearing up for a promotion or simply looking to convey greater gravitas, getting where you want to be starts with determination and self-belief. Set your goals and then focus on how to achieve them. To know what you want is half the battle won. Start by making a list of objectives, and honestly assess where you stand in relation to each aim. Next, jot down the personal and professional qualities you consider vital to career success.</p>
<p>Focus on emphasizing your strengths and improving or enhancing the areas you feel are weak. From there, you’ll be able to identify and apply a unique set of personal values. Executive presence starts with self-awareness — as well as a “sixth sense” of what you can do to make the people you support look good. To succeed, you need to build and project a personal brand that is powerful, credible and consistent.</p>
<h4>2. Look and sound the part</h4>
<p>Dressing professionally gives people credibility, and looking the part can be especially important when you’re in a position that constantly interfaces with executives, clients and other business contacts.</p>
<p>Dressing with executive presence doesn’t always mean starched shirts and serious suits, but it does mean paying attention to the company “look” and emanating it. Keep in mind that in an Office Team survey, 80 percent of managers said clothing choices affect an employee’s chances of earning a promotion. I like to think that the old rule, “Dress to the position you aspire to”, still holds true. Check out the sartorial choices of influential executives at your workplace. If you’ve set your sights on the next level, adjust your work wardrobe accordingly.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to align your body language and voice to match. Scrutinize how you sit, walk, stand and shake hands. For an honest assessment, you may want to ask a trusted friend or colleague for his or her opinion. First impressions persist, so be intentional with yours.</p>
<h4>3. Take a stance</h4>
<p>Decisiveness is a pillar of executive presence, while dilly-dallying projects the exact opposite. When someone gives you options, saying, “Oh, I don’t know — I can never decide. You choose” will create the opposite of the effect you want to have on people. For a more professional image, state your preference. If you need time to reflect, you could say, “Let me think about it and get back to you by end of day.”</p>
<p>Other ways to be decisive: Accept invitations to demonstrate your expertise, give input or contribute to strategic decisions. Be calm and composed in what you say and how you say it, and nix excuses or apologies for any self-perceived lack of experience. Seize opportunities to offer feedback and advice. If you see room for change or improvement, pipe up. Likewise, be open-minded with others who offer insight and value, and apply neutrality to disputes. Commanding executive presence involves listening to conflicting views, reflecting and replying thoughtfully and respectfully.</p>
<p>Take care not to overstep the bound, though. Don’t assert your opinion if you don’t know what you’re talking about. On the other hand, dialing up that self-assured, understanding tone when you know your stuff will get you heard and, more importantly, listened to.</p>
<h4>4. Make allies, not enemies</h4>
<p>Developing an executive presence means being considerate of coworkers. Endeavor to create positive relationships with those above, beside and below you. This means paying strict attention to workplace etiquette, playing nice with workplace politics, politely extricating yourself from office gossip and showing respect to all — regardless of their rank or station.</p>
<p>Find out what others want and what makes them tick. Empathy and intuition are crucial stepping stones to getting ahead at work. Those with executive presence know how to predict and prevent problems, and they don’t skimp on delivering praise to colleagues where it’s due. Recognition and positive feedback go a long way, but don’t go overboard or your kudos could be perceived as hollow flattery.</p>
<h4>5. Master communication</h4>
<p>Strong writing skills are foundational to building an executive presence. Is it time to brush up on yours? Take the time to reread everything you write: emails, letters, memos and reports. Go easy on the exclamation points and emoticons in work-related messages. If you feel your written communication is less than stellar, enroll in a class and explore online tools and resources that could help you up your game.</p>
<p>Pay close attention to the messages and language your firm wishes to convey. Position yourself as a company ambassador in the workplace, when meeting clients and at external events like conferences. Remember to keep an eye on your virtual persona as well by perfecting your digital etiquette.</p>
<h4>6. Take initiatives</h4>
<p>Don’t wait until something’s amiss to rectify it or, worse still, leave it to someone else to correct. If you spot an opportunity to take the lead and mobilize others, seize it. Have ideas on how to improve workplace operations or business strategy? Act. Leaders don’t wait to be asked to act. Be proactive and put your foresight and skills to good use.</p>
<p>But don’t forget to get buy-in from management. As appropriate, approach your supervisor with your suggestions. The better thought-through they are, the more you and your plans will be taken seriously.</p>
<h4>7. Track your progress</h4>
<p>Keeping up executive presence is like physical training: It requires ongoing work and maintenance. Monitor your progress and adjust your goals and approach as necessary.</p>
<p>To test the freshness and relevance of your professional image management, periodically ask yourself some questions, such as:</p>
<p>Do I communicate clearly, directly and decisively?<br />
Do my body language and tone of voice project confidence and credibility?<br />
Does my overall appearance mirror that of an executive?<br />
When I speak up, do people listen and respect what I say?<br />
Do I listen as well as speak, and acknowledge the contributions of others?<br />
Do I connect with people on a personal level?<br />
Do I uphold and transmit my personal values in all work-related matters?<br />
Do I avoid apologizing excessively or keeping quiet when I should speak up?<br />
Do I start or engage in discussions on company issues and specific projects?</p>
<h4>8. Keep it real</h4>
<p>Remember that the aim of having a professional image is to be the best possible version of you. Being genuine is one of the most magnetic and memorable qualities anyone can possess. While it’s good to admire and follow the example of role models, you can’t be someone you aren’t, nor should you even try. Besides, faking it is obvious to others and tiring to yourself.</p>
<p>An executive presence is an essential requisite to effective leadership and a vital asset to any young professional who wants to get ahead. Helping other employees develop a professional image is also an important task for those who manage staff. So, cultivate your executive presence, get ahead and pay it forward.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><b></b><b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">Know why you want to achieve your goals</strong></b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">Ask yourself, what is<b><strong style="font-style: inherit;"> important</strong></b> about achieving my goals? We are all individuals with skills and talents and hopes and dreams. The purpose of goals is to turn your dreams and interests into <b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">measurable </strong></b>achievements. All we need to do is understand that there is greatness in each one of us and then find a way to live up to that potential. We do this by setting goals and <b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">committing</strong></b> to achieving them.</em></i></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><i><em style="font-weight: inherit;"> </em></i></span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><b></b><b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">Identify exactly you want to achieve in 2018</strong></b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">This is the easiest part of <b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">goal setting</strong></b>. Just ask yourself, “What is it that I would like to achieve in 2018?” and then ask, “How will this help me<b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">accomplish</strong></b> my career/business goals?” Once you are clear about what you want to achieve and why, then move to the next step.</em></i></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><i><em style="font-weight: inherit;"> </em></i></span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><b></b><b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">Write 5 goals</strong></b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">To go from wishful thinking to <b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">achieving</strong></b> your goals, write down your top 5 commitments. Why is this important? The research is conclusive. Dr. Gail Matthews, a psychology professor at Dominican University in California, did a study on goal-setting. She found that you are 42 percent more likely to achieve your goals just by <b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">writing them down</strong></b>. From my experience, either writing on paper or on a whiteboard gives a strong effect. So, write down your goals. Make these <b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">goals visible</strong></b> so you see them every day and at various locations throughout the day.</em></i></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><i><em style="font-weight: inherit;"> </em></i></span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><b></b><b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">Make goals measurable</strong></b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">After you have <b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">determined</strong></b> what you would like to achieve, how will you plan to make your goal a reality? You need concrete steps to get to your<b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">destination</strong></b>. To get from point A to B, you need to have a plan. Make your goals measurable, and include dates for completion.  Example: “I want to increase my professional network by 100 people by December 31, 2018.  Each month I will attend a company sponsored event and/or a professional association program.  At these events, I will meet at least 10 new people and add then them to my network.  By the end of 2018, I will have added at a minimum 120 people into my <b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">professional network.”</strong></b></em></i></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><b><strong style="font-style: inherit;"><i><em style="font-weight: inherit;"> </em></i></strong></b></span></p>
<ol start="5">
<li style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><b></b><b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">Do something every day to get you closer to your goal</strong></b></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><i><em style="font-weight: inherit;">How do you make sure that you will <b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">reach</strong></b> your goals? Work on your goals every single day. It doesn’t matter if you spend ten minutes or if you spend two hours on them. Work on pieces of your goals every single day so it is <b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">inevitable </strong></b>you will get what you want. I look at my goals in the morning and then before I go to bed each evening. This helps me to stay <b><strong style="font-style: inherit;">focused </strong></b>on achieving what is important for me.</em></i></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 300;"><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Implement these 5 simple steps and you too will have a greater chance to get what you desire</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[My advice as you leave your university experiences behind is&#160;[&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My advice as you leave your university experiences behind is to remember that you will leave with one thing that no one else has.</p>
<p>There will be hundreds of people out there with your same degree; there will be thousands of people doing what you want to do for a living and even more with higher aspirations.But you will be the only person who has sole ownership of your life and career.</p>
<p>So, here are 10 things that will help you to remain your unique self that I wish someone had told me at my university graduation 5 years ago:</p>
<p>Stay true to your authentic self, learn your passion and pursue it. Don’t let others define who you are or who you are not. Don’t be a square peg in a round hole.</p>
<p>The best communicators listen more and talk less. Ask questions. Curiosity connects you to others and the world at a much deeper level. There are always at least two sides to a story.</p>
<p>Never stop learning. When you do something wrong acknowledge it and learn the lesson. That is how you become competent.</p>
<p>Speak your truth with conviction and without fear. Be confident and have a healthy sense of self. When you get knocked down (and you will!), get back up and persevere.</p>
<p>Have the courage to question most of what you see, read or hear. Be a risk taker. Go where there are no guarantees. Get out of your comfort zone, even if it means being uncomfortable. Live in a foreign country. You will have great stories to tell your children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>“I don’t know” is ok to use when you are unsure. The other side of the coin is to always be decisive. Don’t be afraid to change course. Nothing is permanent.</p>
<p>Study people, so you understand why they do what they do. Be emotionally intelligent and be clear about how your emotions are impacting your actions and relationships. Emotions are your wise elders.</p>
<p>Have a set of strong values and keep these intact in everything you do. Integrity is the foundation for how you live your life and the glue for your relationships. Be mindful of whom you call friends and those you spend time with. Don’t trust everybody you will meet.</p>
<p>Be mindful of your presence. Learn to match your perception of yourself and others perception of you. Presence includes what you say, how your dress and how you connect with people. Don’t let others define you.</p>
<p>Listen carefully to the many knocks of opportunity. Keep your vision alive, be a forward thinker and shuffle the deck every now and then. Don’t become complacent and don’t let others derail your goals.</p>
<p>Life happens fast, and it will present challenges that you cannot even imagine. Be prepared to reach down deep and find the inner fortitude you need after disappointments big and small, and the painful losses that are an inevitable part of life.</p>
<p>The road less traveled is sometimes fraught with hurdles, bumps, and uncharted terrain. But it is on that road where your character is truly tested — and your personal growth realized.</p>
<p>For whatever happens, just remember to pick yourself up and press ahead. It’s not always easy, but it is guaranteed to be something better, more lasting and much more satisfying.</p>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
